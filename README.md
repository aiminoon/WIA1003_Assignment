# WIA1003 Computer Systems and Architecture – Lab Assignments
This repository contains assembly language solutions for lab assignments in the WIA1003 Computer Systems and Architecture course at Universiti Malaya.

## Objectives
The main goals of this assignment are to:
- Reinforce students’ understanding of computer organization and low-level programming.
- Apply Assembly Language to solve arithmetic and logical problems.
- Explore how low-level instructions interact with hardware architecture.
- Improve debugging skills and logic formulation in an Assembly environment.

## Background & Requirements
### Introduction
The assignments involved calculating the sum of gaps between elements in an array and generating a sequence of numbers. The provided solutions are written in x86 assembly language using Irvine32 library functions.

### Minimal Requirements
- The code must be written in x86 assembly language using Irvine32 library functions.
- Each .asm file must be independently executable.
- Programs must handle input/output operations, use register-based processing, and include logical flow control (loops, conditions).

## Submission Requirements
The repository must include:
- Complete .asm source code for each question
- PDF of final lab report with:
  - Code explanations
  - Execution outputs (screenshots or console logs)
  - Reflection on system limitations and learning outcomes

## How to Use This Repository
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Open any .asm file using Visual Studio.
- Assemble and run to observe the output. Refer to the report for expected results.
